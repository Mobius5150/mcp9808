# MCP9808 Temperature Sensor Library
A simple C library for the Microchip MCP9808 temperature sensor.

I wrote this because most existing libraries did not export most of the MCP9808's features (like shutdown modes), or weren't written in simple C.

This library was originally written for an ATtiny25, and I am still undergoing the process of generalizing it. If you would like my I2C code to go along with it, drop me a line.
